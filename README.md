Generalized Van der Waals demos

This repository contains a number of Jupyter notebooks designed to illustrate concepts found in the book, Generalized van der Waals Theory of Molecular Fluids in Bulk and at Surfaces. They include the following notebooks:

- vdw_isotherms.ipynb - allows the user to specify the temperature and plot the isotherm of the classical van der Waals equation

- vdw_free_energy_isotherms.ipynb - allows the user to specify the temperature and plot the free menergy isotherm of the classical van der Waals equation

After selecting one of the notebooks, the user should run the notebook by selecting the Run All menu item under the Cell Menu. At this stage a set of controls will become active that will allow the user to specify input parameters for plotting, calculations, whatever. There may be more specific instructions in the notebook as well.
